# PiCAS
My attempt at creating a Collision Avoidance System (CAS), based on a Raspberry Pi, Dump1090, a GPS receiver, and a battery pack. It is intended to be a portable solution for use in a Private Airplane, so it needs to fulfill certain hardware requirements regarding weight, portability, EMC, that sort of stuff. For the rest I foresee combining exisiting software with self-written code to knit them all together, and create a more decluttered GUI than a default Google Maps map with plane icons.
Still very much in development. Just starting out (Januari 2016)
